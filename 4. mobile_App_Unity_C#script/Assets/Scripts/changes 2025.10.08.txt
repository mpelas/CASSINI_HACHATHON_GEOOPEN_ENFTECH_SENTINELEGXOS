Facility name (English & Greek)
Municipality and region
Receiver water body details

File location: Application.persistentDataPath (accessible on all platforms)
UI log shows truncated view, but file contains complete history
Perfect for hackathon demonstration!

3. Native File Sharing

Android: Opens native share dialog (Gmail, Drive, WhatsApp, etc.)
iOS: Saves to app documents + copies to clipboard
Desktop: Opens the folder containing the log file
Button renamed from "Email Log" to "Save & Share Log"

📱 File Locations:

iOS: App's Documents folder (accessible via Files app)
Windows: C:\Users\YourName\AppData\LocalLow\CompanyName\AppName\

🎯 For Your Hackathon Demo:
The app now creates a complete audit trail showing:

Exact GPS coordinates with timestamps
Full API responses with all facility details
Alarm activation/deactivation events
All error messages
Real-time compliance status changes

The log file will be perfect evidence for the committee showing the app working in real-time!
Note: For Android sharing to work perfectly, you may need to add FileProvider to your AndroidManifest.xml for Android 7.0+. Let me know if you need help with that configuration!
